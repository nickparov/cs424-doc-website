                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Interface.</li>
                            <p>When you visit the application website the interface is pretty intuitive. <br>
                                App main window is divided into two parts: <b>Menu (Controls and Pages), Currently Displayed Data.</b><br>
                                There are three selectors available in the Menu part: three years to select for specific stations' rides. <br>
                                Similarly, there are 3 pages available: About page, Tables page and the initial Graphs page.
                            </p>
                            <li>Data</li>
                            <p>
                                The data that is being initially displayed when a user visits a website is being selected from 2021 year <br>
                                and the data is about rides of 3 particular stations. In our case the stations are O'Hare, UIC-Halsted and Central Lake.
                            </p>
                            <li>Graphs & Tables</li>
                            <p>
                                All Data is being divided in Graphs and Tables. <br>
                                There are total 5 different Graphs and Tables that represent the state of data at their specific range of time.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>All years</li>
                                    <li>Each month</li>
                                    <li>Each day</li>
                                    <li>Each Weekday</li>
                                    <li>All days</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">Data & Manipulations</h4>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Where was it taken?</li>
                            <p>
                                All data you see is taken from Chicago Data Portal <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-L-Station-Entries-Daily-Totals/5neh-572f">Here</a><br>
                                Given Dataset consisted of different stations across Chicago and their number of rides along with their date and time.
                            </p>
                            <li>Manipulations.</li>
                            <p>
                                The manipulations to Data that I did was converting the full date into three different columns and adding <br>
                                those columns to initial dataframe because it only consisted of string type value for dates and not separate D/M/Y format columns. <br>
                                The other manipulation was to filter out specific data for three stations each from 2021 year.  <br>
                                Another one was to get weekdays names because they were not intially present in the given data. <br>
                            </p>
                            <li>Tables Data representation</li>
                            <p>
                                In order to display data using Tables I took the specidfic sum of values from rides columns filtered by specific year.<br>
                                This allowed me to get the needed data for each type of graph that you see on the website.
                            </p>
                            <li>Graphs Data representation</li>
                            <p>
                                Similarly, for each graph I actually did not do any manipulations because the R language deals with the selected displaying data itself. <br>
                                In order for it to show the correct data, I just selected the needed columns for the axis x, y which resulted in correct graphs.
                            </p>
                        </ol>
                    </p>


                    <h4 class="mt-5">Interesting Insights from Data.</h4>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Rides during COVID-19 start?</li>
                            <p>
                                If you look closely at all years data for UIC-Halsted staion (which is the first column) you will see the significant drop in 2020. <br>
                                Same tendency can be seen for the other stations. <br>
                                However, O'Hare station stats did not really change as we can see that the number of rides did not variate from the previous months.

                        </ol>
