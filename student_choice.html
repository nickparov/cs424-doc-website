                    - Each year a new framework is being created 
                    - Compare the use of technologies in 2021 and 2020 (such techs as: typescript, express, web pack and jest were on the rise a year ago and now they are even higher and better in 2021)
                    - Direction in which the technology is inclined predicts its future state.
                    - Conclusions are: 
                        - Js is in a much better shape compared to its state in 2016
                        - Typescript overall usage has increased over time (static type js) by 50%
