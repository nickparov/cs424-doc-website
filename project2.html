          <h5 class="card-title">About the app</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            The application was created to visualize the data about all Chicago
            Stations on both the Bar Charts and Interactive Map. Data depicts
            the number of rides that was taken on those stations from 2001 to
            2021 (November) as well as their coordinates. You can see that the
            dashboard is divided into four columns and each column and each pair
            of two represent first and selcond selected station accordingly and
            a huge interactive map on the right side. First row shows the total
            entries for all stations on a selected day in bar chart form as well
            as in table form. The next row is about rides per day for the first
            station as well as the second one and you can see the data being
            shown in a bar charts and tables. After that, the following row
            contains information about rides per day of the week for the both
            stations. Then, the next row shows info about rides per month for
            both stations. Finally the last row is for displaying total rides
            per each year for both stations. The menu on the right consists of
            two tabs and four main input fields that you can interact with.
            There are 2 tabs which navigate to Dashboard and About Page. Through
            the four input fields in the menu you can choose the specific date,
            2 particular stations and a map scheme which will update the
            interface accordingly and show the relevant information. Selection
            of one station does not change the info that is being displayed for
            the other one and vice versa, so that they do not overlap in terms
            of UI and to be clear what is shown for which station. On the about
            page, where you can navigate by clicking About Page tab, you will
            find why we created this application and where the data was taken
            from.

          <h5 class="card-title">Where the data was taken from?</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            The dataset was taken from the official Chicago Data Portal website
            which has data about all stations in Chicago area. This list shows
            daily totals of ridership, by station entry, for each 'L' station
            dating back to 2001. Dataset shows entries at all turnstiles,
            combined, for each station. Ridership statistics are provided on a
            system-wide and bus route/station-level basis. Ridership is
            primarily counted as boarding, that is, customers boarding a transit
            vehicle (bus or rail). On the rail system, there is a distinction
            between station entries and total rides, or boarding. Datasets
            indicate such in their file name and description. In order to
            analyze the data in R, We read the file and took only the stations
            we needed. However, when we saw that roughly 77 stations locations
            were missing, we found them all out and put it into our separate tsv
            file and parsed it thereafter to get the full data so that we don't
            have holes in our dataset when finished. Afterwards, we parsed the
            data and did some manipulations to it so that we got the following
            things: Date separated into columns, names of weekdays and months,
            combined coordinates of all stations and separated into long and lat
            columns. We used functions such as: aggregate, left_join, paste,
            pull, sub, substr and etc. That was done in order to get the needed
            pieces of data and compose one huge table that contained all the
            relevant data in correct format. All graphs were rendered by using
            ggplot2 lib.

            1. First of all, if you take a look at the map which shows all
            available stations in the dataset with color that represents the
            total number of rides, we can clearly see that the majority of heavy
            loaded stations which are marked with red color are in the following
            places: downtown, region upper downtown and the last stations.
            Specifically, in south-west, south and north-west parts of Chicago
            (Midway Airport, O'Hare Airport, 95th/Dan Ryan). By observing these
            stations we see that almost on each day they stay the most loaded
            stations. That is due to the fact that the most number of people
            would like to travel from these places. For example, it is obvious
            that in downtown huge amount of people take rides because it is the
            center of the city, but what about the outskirts? Why outskirts last
            stations are red? We think that is because people that come from
            rural parts of chicago that do not have direct close access to CTA
            station but only to that last station would take either a car or a
            bus to that particular station. We can also see that the stations
            are positioned in a way that results in giving an even level of
            access from any place in the city, but those people from those regions that 
            positioned far from ending stations can take a ride only on them, so that's 
            the reason for those ending stations to have a high load </br>
            2. Another interesting thing we saw is that if we take a look at the map and compare number 
            of high volumed stations in 2021 and in 2010, they show that stations were used more often in 2021 than in 2010. 
            We think that is the case because overall CTA system was optimised in a way that the higher number
            of people became more distributed between bus and train stations as more and more stations were created 
            and larger number of buses and new routes were becoming available with each year.
