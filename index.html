            I like how each station has designated columns adjacent to each
            other. This makes it easy for users to look at a row and have an
            immediate comparison based on which visualization the user is
            focusing on (by day, weekday, month, or year). In addition, having
            all of the graphs on the page allows users to deal with minimal
            input, which in this case, all they have to do is choose the year
            that they want for each station. All tables are in one place and the
            graphs on their own tab which makes it easier to look at. It was
            also a nice idea to flip the bar chart of daily ridership, since
            that way it’s easier to see how ridership changes throughout the
            year.

            Good segmentation on the fluid page layouts. This gives a uniform
            look to for each station’s visualizations. I also think it’s a good
            idea that each of the bar graph is paired with their data table form
            below. This allows users to quickly navigate through specific data
            if closely examining a specific part of the bar graph. I also think
            it was a good idea to visualize 2 stations, because realistically,
            users can probably only effectively compare 2 sets of data at a
            time. In addition, the amount of user input needed is minimal, which
            makes usability much simpler. The layout of all the graphs and
            tables makes comparisons quick and easy, switching stations is
            placed in a good spot.

            It’s nice that it has a lot of controls and the user is able to
            select exactly what it wants to appear on the screen, which can be
            useful to avoid the website looking overcrowded -What I like about
            this implementation of the project is that the user has a lot of
            control on what visualization they want to appear on the screen.
            This allows users to isolate the data they want to see without
            getting distracted by other elements of the UI.

            It’s nice that everything is in one page, and individual controls
            for each graph and that the user can choose which data tables to
            look at. The colors for each station help with making the data clear
            where it came from.

            <b>Why?</b>
            Because for presentation purposes this solution is the best fit. <br>
            It allows people to see the differences between stations much easier and more intuitive than the other ones.
